# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: worked on learing react router from LS-Pro

**Thoughts:** I'm starting this with day 1 instead of day 0.  Pointing this out because I guess most folks start with 0.  I already tweeted R1D1 so I'll start the log with 1.  React router seems pretty straightforward.  Going to work now on the homework portion, already did the lesson/tutorial portion.
