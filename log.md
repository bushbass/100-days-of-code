**Today's Progress**: Reviewing some HTML/CSS on Udacity google scholarship like everyone else...  also working on a React Udemy class(david katz, music master).  Definitely made up for yesterday's < hour 

**Thoughts:**  this google udacity scholarship is not what I exactly expected.  Definitely going to be 98% review, plus it seems like they barely turned anyone away.  maybe at least get some networking out of it?

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: worked on learing react router from LS-Pro part 4

**Thoughts:** I'm starting this with day 1 instead of day 0.  Pointing this out because I guess most folks start with 0.  I already tweeted R1D1 so I'll start the log with 1.  React router seems pretty straightforward.  Going to work now on the homework portion, already did the lesson/tutorial portion.
